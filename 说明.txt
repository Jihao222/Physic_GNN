# Physic_GNN

Code implementation for : [Hydrogen jet diffusion modeling by using physics-informed graph neural network and sparsely-distributed sensor data]


# Installation
## Requirements
* Python >= 3.6
* cuda == 10.2
* Tensorflow == 1.14.0


# Usage
Three case studies are listed on low-pressure subsonic vertical jets, high-pressure under-expanded vertical jets, and high-pressure under-expanded horizontal jets.
The following is an example of how the algorithm is used for the prediction of a low pressure subsonic vertical hydrogen jet.
